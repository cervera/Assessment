Hi!, for this assessment I create two different projects in the same solution, the first one Technical Assessment , 
contains a REST webservices who calls directly to CyberSource REST API.

The project "webclient" contains two pages, the first one named "checkout.html" where you can try the payment process (1 call for auth and capture, and 2 call auth and capture),
all the payments should be validated by decision manager before go to the payment process.After each payment a new record should be stored in a database, you will find two scripts
to create the database and table needed for the proces, also you will find a csv with some test examples (YOU SHOULD CREATE THE DATABASE AND TABLE BEFORE EXECUTE THE APPLICATION).

The client is named "RefunReverse.cshtl" who contains a client to verify the reverse and refund methods.

Please contact me if you have any doubt.
